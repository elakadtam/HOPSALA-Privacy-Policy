HOPSALA: Privacy Policy
Welcome to the HOPSALA games privacy policy for Android!

This is an open source Android game developed by David Armand Vedres. The source code is available on GitHub inside KijeviGombooc/LizaNoemi folders; the game is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when games and apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this game to collect any personally identifiable information. All data preferences (save files) are stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or by uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

My game has also doesn't include anything, that can be questionable above 3 years.

Yours sincerely,
David Armand Vedres
